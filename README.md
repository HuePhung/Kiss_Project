# KISS

Kiss is a mobile application which allows you to scan, manage and analyze cosmetic products. 
All you have to do is take a picture of the product and kiss will do the rest.
Kiss is intended for people who want to be more concious about their cosmetic products. 
Kiss keeps track of your allergies and warns you whenever you scan a product with an allergic ingredient in it. 
Kiss runs on both IOS and Android and doens’t require an internet connection after the initial download.
